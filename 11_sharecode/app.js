// There is no need to share all the node_modules
// therefore it is best if they are placed in a gitignore file where they will be ignored when sharing
// gitignore file is a file which controles which files will be ignored by the source controle

// now if you want to clone the rep then all you need to do to get those modules back is type npm install, it will install all the modules that are in the package.json file
